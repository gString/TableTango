A test for Cynerio Ltd.

Notes:

- No unit tests or prop-types, for brevity sake

- No loading or error handling - but the 'hooks' are there

- Tested on Mac: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari

- Used Redux, but I do think Mobx would have been better suited

- Did not used React context, as it didn't justified the extra code in this case

- As the CSS code is tiny, I did not bother with any css optimization
